# LFIHunt üïµÔ∏è‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

LFIHunt is a Python tool designed to streamline the process of exploiting Local File Inclusion (LFI) vulnerabilities. It employs a range of techniques to attempt to exploit these vulnerabilities and, if successful, offers automatic shell access or file reading.

## üöÄ Getting Started

To install LFIHunt, start by cloning the repository, then install the required dependencies with pip:

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/Chocapikk/LFIHunt.git
$ cd LFIHunt/
$ pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## üõ†Ô∏è Usage

To start LFIHunt, simply run the Python script from the command line:

```bash
$ python LFIHunt.py
```

Once launched, you will see the following prompt:

```
   __    ________                   _
  / /   / __\_   \/\  /\_   _ _ __ | |_

Enter site URL to test: http://example.com

Select a module to run:
1: PHPInputExploiter
2: PHPFilterChainGenerator
3: DataChecker
4: PHPFilterChecker
5: EnvironChecker
6: PHPPearCmdChecker
7: LFIChecker
8: Change URL
>>>
```

The tool provides several modules, each corresponding to a different LFI exploitation technique:

1. **PHPInputExploiter** - exploits vulnerability using the `php://input` technique.
2. **PHPFilterChainGenerator** - exploits vulnerability using `php://filter` chains.
3. **DataChecker** - exploits vulnerability using the `data://` technique.
4. **PHPFilterChecker** - exploits vulnerability using the `php://filter` technique.
5. **EnvironChecker** - exploits vulnerability using the `/proc/self/environ` technique.
6. **PHPPearCmdChecker** - exploits vulnerability using the PearCmd shell technique.
7. **LFIChecker** - uses a fuzzer to test for various LFI exploitation methods.
8. **Change URL** - allows you to change the site URL to test.

Upon finding a vulnerability, the tool will offer automatic shell access for exploitation or offer file reading.
